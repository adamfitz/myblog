I found this recently, and after some googling it is apparently this is an edited version of a quote made by Konstantin Jireček [(make of that what you will)](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/13/anything/), in this instance applied to the daily grind of IT workers.

> “We, the unwilling, led by the unable, have been doing the unbelievable for so long, with so little, that now we attempt to do the impossible with nothing”.
