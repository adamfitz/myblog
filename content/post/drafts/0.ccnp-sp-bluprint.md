I am going to start blogging the blueprint, notes and labs for CCNP SPCOR exam as I will be using this exam to 
recertify my CCNP Enterprise which is up for renewal next year.

CCNP SPCOR Exam topics:

[350-501 SPCOR Exam Topics](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/spcor-exam-topics)

Software versions:

I did not find a list of the IOS-XE and IOS-XR software versions specifically listed for
the 350-501 CCNP SPCOR exam.  There is a software version list for the CCIE SP v5, and I
think that this will be sufficient to assume the same versions for CCNP.

I took the below software versions from here: [CCIE Service Provider (v5.0) Equipment and Software List](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/ccie-service-provider-v5-0-equipment-and-software-list)
and removed Cisco Network Service Orchestrator (NSO) as I dont see this as part of the CCNP SP at least not the core exam.

```
RR, P, and PE role: Cisco ASR 9000 Series running IOS-XR 6.5 Release
RR and PE role: Cisco ASR 1000 series running IOS-XE 16.6.5 Release
PE and CE role: Cisco Edge Routers running IOS-XE 16.6.5 Release
Access and Aggregation: Cisco Access series running IOS 3.2.1S Release
```

For lab equipment I am using an eve-ng server I have and ill be spending time labbing the topics with the 
"implement" or the "configure and verify" keywords, for example: Implement IS-IS, OSPF, BGP, configure and verify 
control plane security, BGP sec etc.


I am using the following lab images:
- CSR1000v 16.06.07 Denali
- CSR1000v 03.17
- XRv9K 6.0.1

I am building a study schedule at the moment I am working on one and a half hours a day at least 3 days a week with two hours each
weekend day.  Of that I wll be alloting time to reading the material, implementing what I have just read and writing a short blog
post on the topic or part thereof.

I will see how I am progressing (or procrastinating) and adjust time wise based on how I feel I am going.

I am going to blog a list of exam topics and the corresponding study resources (books, articles, Cisco Live 
presentations, blogs etc), similar to the CCIE spreadsheet [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/training-events/le31/le46/cln/marketing/learning-matrix/CCIE-Service-Provider-v5-Learning-Matrix.xlsx)
and its likely I will use links to some of these resources as well.
