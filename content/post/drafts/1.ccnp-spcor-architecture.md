The Architecture topics section is 15% of the overall exam, the topics and associated study materials I am 
using/collecting is below.  Its difficult to know how deep to go into these topics, we can an idea from the section percentage at 15% I would
not expect expert deep dive knowledge on each topic, but perhaps a good introduction and overview of the technologies
 and how, where and in which situation they would be expected to be used.

# 1.0 Architecture Topics

For a variety of the below 1.1 topics I am using the free trial of the [Cisco SPCOR online e-learning course](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/on-demand-e-learning/implementing-and-operating-cisco-service-provider-network-core-technologies-spcor-v1.0/ELT-SPCOR-V1-024029.html) 
from Cisco learning.  The trial only gives you access to the first section (Describing service provider network 
architectures) and I haven't been through it all yet, but there seems to be some good information for the 1.1 
architecture section and its free.

## 1.1 Describe service provider architectures
