The Architecture topics section is 15% of the overall exam, the topics and associated study materials I am 
using/collecting is below.  Its difficult to know how deep to go into these topics, we can an idea from the section percentage at 15% I would
not expect expert deep dive knowledge on each topic, but perhaps a good introduction and overview of the technologies
 and how, where and in which situation they would be expected to be used.

# 1.0 Architecture

## 1.1 Describe service provider architectures
### 1.1a Core architectures (Metro Ethernet, MPLS, unified MPLS, SR)

- MPLS Introduction 1.3
- Unified MPLS: 1.4

[Metro Ethernet by Sam Halabi](https://www.amazon.com/Metro-Ethernet-paperback-Sam-Halabi/dp/1587055376)

- Chapter 1: Introduction to Data in the Metro
  - The Metro Network
  - Ethernet in the Metro
- Chapter 2: Metro Technologies
  - Ethernet Transport
- Chapter 3: Metro Ethernet Services
  - Challenges with All-Ethernet Metro Networks





### 1.1.b Transport technologies (Optical, xDSL, DOCSIS, TDM, and xPON)
### 1.1.c Mobility (packet core, RAN xhaul transport for 4G and 5G)
[Cisco SPCOR online e-learning course](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/on-demand-e-learning/implementing-and-operating-cisco-service-provider-network-core-technologies-spcor-v1.0/ELT-SPCOR-V1-024029.html)
- RAN Introduction 1.9
- 5G Networks 1.11 

For each of the above 1.1 topics I am using the free trial of the [Cisco SPCOR online e-learning course](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/on-demand-e-learning/implementing-and-operating-cisco-service-provider-network-core-technologies-spcor-v1.0/ELT-SPCOR-V1-024029.html) 
from Cisco learning.  The trial only gives you access to the first section (Describing service provider network 
architectures) and I haven't been through it all yet, but there seems to be some good information for the 1.1 
architecture section and its free.
