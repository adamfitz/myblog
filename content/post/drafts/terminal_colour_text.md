# Changing the text colour in linux terminal

When displaying stdout information to the user I wanted to find a way to make it more obviously make the important parts of the bash script stand out or get the users attention.  

Thanks to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5947742/how-to-change-the-output-color-of-echo-in-linux) on stackoverflow it turned out it was pretty easy to change specific text using ANSCII escape codes and the just echo to stdout as normal.
