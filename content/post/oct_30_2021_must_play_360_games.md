Well my pic for the ones I will likely try and buy off ebay once I get a working 360

- Brutal Legend
- Guitar hero (which one??)
- The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
- Shadow Complex
- Burnout Paradise (maybe - already got the remaster on Switch)
- Rock Band/Rock Band 2 (but need to buy the peripherals eg: guitars, drums, base and mic and they are pricey =/)
- Super Street Fighter IV (because I have teh Mayflash f500 fight stick BUT will need an official 360 wired controller to use this...again expensive)
- Forza Motorsport 3
- Dragon Age: Origins
- Batman: Arkham Asylum (not sure since I already got Origins on PC)
- Mass Effect 1/2/3
- Assassin's Creed 2
- Red Dead Redemption
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (do I have a million hours to play this?? )
- Fable 2
- Dirt 2
