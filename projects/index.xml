      <description>This is a repost of a site to site VPN config with low end Cisco ISR routers, I wrote a few years ago as a proof of concept for replacing a small MPLS network for a managed service provider I was working for. At the time I had not setup ipsec VPNs before so I documented the steps I went through here...
The purpose of this post is to document the configuration commands and give an outline to the process of configuring site to site VPN connection as I had a little trouble getting a clear picture of what each command did and why it was being used.</description>
