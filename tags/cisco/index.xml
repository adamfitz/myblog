      <description>CCNP 350-501 SPCOR I am starting study for the 350-501 SPCOR exam to recertify my CCNP Enterprise (R&amp;amp;S). As part of this I am going to blog the exam topics and materials I am using as there is no official certificate guide for this exam. Each page focuses on a section from the exam topics/blueprint and the corresponding materials (books, blogs, cisco documentation etc) that I am going to use for study.</description>

      <description>This is a repost of a site to site VPN config with low end Cisco ISR routers, I wrote a few years ago as a proof of concept for replacing a small MPLS network for a managed service provider I was working for. At the time I had not setup ipsec VPNs before so I documented the steps I went through here...
The purpose of this post is to document the configuration commands and give an outline to the process of configuring site to site VPN connection as I had a little trouble getting a clear picture of what each command did and why it was being used.</description>
