      <description>In this post I will demonstrate how to use wireshark to troubleshoot an area type mismatch. I came across this while labbing basic OSPF configuration and finding that one of the neighbour adjacencies would not form. The issue was that on router NSSA-R1 I had correctly configured area 23 nssa to enable the NSSA area, however on the adjacent router (IOS-XE-2) I had accidentally configured area 23 stub.&#xA;The relevant lab topology I am using is as follows:</description>

      <description>Using the passive interface or passive enable command in OSPF stops an adjacency forming over a specific router interface. An interface that has been set to passive still has its IP address injected into the OSPF domain and is seen as a STUB network.&#xA;This allows interface addresses to be advertised into the OSPF domain but also stops LSA generation / flooding from occurring for interfaces where an adjacency is not expected to be formed.</description>
