      <description>Using the passive interface or passive enable command in OSPF stops an adjacency forming over a specific router interface. An interface that has been set to passive still has its IP address injected into the OSPF domain and is seen as a STUB network.
This allows interface addresses to be advertised into the OSPF domain but also stops LSA generation / flooding from occurring for interfaces where an adjacency is not expected to be formed.</description>
